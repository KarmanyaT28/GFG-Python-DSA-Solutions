'''Given the first 2 terms a and b of a Geometric Series. The task is to find the nth term of the series.

Examples:

Input: a = 2, b = 3, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The first term is already given in the input as 2
Input: a = 1, b = 2, n = 5
Output: 16
Explanation: Common ratio = 2,Hence Fifth term is 1*(2)(5-1) = 24 = 16 .
Constraints:
-100 ≤ a, b ≤ 100
  1 ≤ n ≤ 9'''

class Solution:
    def termOfGP(self, a, b, n):
        #code here
        r= b/a
        p = r**(n-1)
        return a*p
