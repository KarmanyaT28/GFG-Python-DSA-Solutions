You are given an interger n, find the absolute value of the integer n.

Examples:

Input: n = -32
Output: 32
Explanation:The absolute value of -32 is 32.
Input: n = 45
Output: 45
Explanation: The absolute value of 45 is 45 itself.
Constraints:
-106 ≤ n ≤ 106'''

class Solution:
    def absolute(self,n):
        if n<0:
            num = n*-1
        else:
            num = n
        return num
